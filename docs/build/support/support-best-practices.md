# Best Practices for Getting Support on zkSync

## Resources

### AI-Powered Assistance
Leverage AI tools tailored for different aspects of zkSync development:

- **GleenAI**: A specialized AI trained on zkSync, offering precise answers to your development questions. Access it directly [here](https://gleen.ai/playground/zksync) or via the ðŸ“Ÿâ”‚dev-ai-support channel in our Discord community.
- **ChatGPT**: While not zkSync-specific, ChatGPT can assist in identifying errors and guiding through contract logic. Opt for ChatGPT 4 for enhanced accuracy. Access ChatGPT [here](https://chat.openai.com/).
- **Phind**: A developer-centric AI similar to ChatGPT, Phind excels in web searches for coding solutions. Check out Phind [here](https://www.phind.com/).

### Community and Team Support

- **GitHub Discussions**: The prime spot for community and developer team support on zkSync. Managed by Matter Labs DevRel team, it's where you can share, discuss, and solve development challenges. Visit the [zkSync Developer Hub](https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zkync-developers/discussions).
- **Discord Community**: Connect with fellow zkSync developers in the ðŸ–¥â”‚dev-general channel for real-time conversations and support. Learn how to access the developer section through this [tutorial](https://scribehow.com/shared/Discord_Developer_Role_Tutorial__swfuu3GeTP6ErGZoSksw7Q).

## Optimizing Your Support

Engaging with the zkSync community for support can significantly enhance your development experience. Below are strategies to effectively navigate resources like AI tools, GitHub Discussions, and Discord. These practices ensure you quickly find solutions and contribute positively to the community.

### Leveraging AI for Coding Support

When seeking answers from AI for coding or developer questions optimizing how you ask can vastly improve the assistance you receive. Here are key strategies:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly outline the problem you're facing, including error messages and code snippets (where permissible). Define error messages and code separate from the ask so the AI can provide optimal support. Specificity helps the AI understand the context and provide relevant solutions.
2. **Use Clear and Concise Language**: Avoid ambiguity. Clear, concise questions are easier for AI to process, leading to more accurate responses.
3. **Define the Scope**: Indicate the technology stack, libraries, or frameworks involved. For instance, specifying you're working with zkSync on an ERC20 token project directs the AI to tailor its answers.
4. **Mention What You've Tried**: Briefly state the solutions or troubleshooting steps you've already attempted. This prevents the AI from suggesting actions you've taken, saving time and effort.
5. **Set Expectations**: If you're looking for a general overview, an in-depth explanation, or step-by-step instructions, mention it. This helps the AI adjust its response depth and detail.

### Utilizing GitHub Discussions and Discord

For community-driven platforms like GitHub Discussions and Discord, here are practices to enhance your support experience and contribute to community efficiency:

**Discord and Github Discussions** 

1. **Use the Search Feature First**: Before posting a new question, search for existing discussions or messages related to your issue. This minimizes duplicates and leverages existing solutions, accelerating your troubleshooting process.

**Github Discussions**

1. **Leverage Tags and Labels**: On GitHub Discussions, use tags to narrow down your search to the most relevant posts. Clicking the "Label" button near the search bar offers insights into the purpose of each label, guiding your search.
2. **Select the Correct Category**: When creating a new post on GitHub Discussions, carefully choose the right category. Accurate categorization ensures your question reaches the right experts and facilitates quicker responses.
3. **Sort Posts for Efficiency**: Utilize sorting options to find answered questions or the most relevant discussions. This can often lead you to solutions without the need for a new post.
4. **Provide Complete Information**: When posting a new query, include all necessary details â€” code snippets, error messages, what you've tried, and specific questions. This clarity aids others in providing accurate and timely support.
5. **Be Patient and Follow Up**: After posting, give the community time to respond. If you find a solution elsewhere or solve the problem yourself, update your post to help others who might face the same issue.
6. **Contribute to the Community**: If you come across questions you can answer, contribute your knowledge. Supporting others not only fosters a positive community atmosphere but also enhances your own understanding and reputation within the community.

Following these guidelines not only streamlines your search for solutions but also enriches the community resources, making them more valuable for everyone involved.
